# DiTellaML
This repository contains projects and excersises I solved through the course of the MiM Analytics Master at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.

The repo will be structured in the different subjects I coursed during the Master. Most of the times, there were some practical excersies to solve with python, some TP solved with R. 

In other words, in this repo you'll find not only **Machine Learning** notebooks, but also some good coding practices, some statistical excersies, etc.

Have fun!
